# Mongoose Movies


## Introduction
As a summary of out basic CRUD journey, we will work on creating the app for movies and celebrities.
The goal of this exercise is to practice *CRUD* on at least one of the models (building the full CRUD for the *movie model* is mandatory) and *documents relationships* (between the two models), just like we did in out *library-project*.
So let's see what are some user stories related to the *celebrity* model:

- The user should be able to:

**1. Add new celebrities**\
**2. See the list of celebrities**

**BONUS** for celebrities model:
- See the details of a specific celebrity
- Update existing celebrities
- Delete celebrities

**Please come back to the bonus part when you finish the full CRUD on *movie* model.**

In the second part of the application, when you already have a couple of celebrities in your database, let's figure out what we will do regarding *movie* model. As we said, we will have a full CRUD on this model, which means the user can:

**6. Add new movies**\
**7. See the list of all movies**\
**8. See the details of a specific movie**\
**9. Update existing movies**\
**10. Delete movies**

Now when we know the overview of the app, let's proceed to creating it.


## Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo


## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "done"
$ git push origin master
```
- Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.


## Instructions

### Iteration 0 | Initialize the project

After forking and cloning the project, you will have to add a `starter_code/.env` file and add in it the following line:

```
PORT=3000
```

And you have to install all the dependencies:

```bash
$ cd starter_code
$ npm install
```

Now you are ready to start 🚀

## Iteration #1: Setting the folders/files structure

In order to have everything organized, we will first create a couple of folders and files. 
- **Routes**: In our `routes` folder, let's create separate files for our `celebrities` and `movies`. The naming is up to you, but we will use the following: `routes/celebrities-routes.js` and `routes/movies-routes.js`;
- **Views**: To keep things nice and clean, we will also create separate folders for `celebrities` and `movies`: `views/celebrities` and `views/movies`. Also, we will create a couple of files in each folder:
    - `views/celebrities/celebrities.hbs`
    - `views/celebrities/new-celebrity.hbs`
    - `views/celebrities/celebrity-details.hbs`
    - `views/celebrities/edit-celebrity.hbs`

    - `views/movies/new-movie.hbs`
    - `views/movies/movies.hbs`
    - `views/movies/movie-details.hbs`
    - `views/movies/edit-movie.hbs`

Obviously, naming is the matter of preference so we used very descriptive names for routes and views.

## Iteration #2: The `celebrity` model

Our first step is to create the `celebrity` model and add some celebrities in our database.

The `celebrity` model should have:
- `name` - String (like _Tom Cruise, Beyonce, Daffy Duck,_ etc.)
- `occupation` - String (what the celebrity does, why they are famous.  For example _actor, singer, comedian_, or you can put _unknown_ if your celebrity is someone like Kim Kardashian)
- `catchPhrase` - String (every celebrity needs a good catch phrase.  Well maybe not all of them have one in real life, but all of _our_ celebrities will have a catch phrase.  This can be pretty much anything.)


### Steps we will follow in this iteration:

1. Create the `celebrity.js` model file in the `models` folder.
2. In the `celebrity.js` model file:
    - Create the `Celebrity` model with the schema.
    - Create the celebrity schema with `name`, `occupation` and `catchPhrase`.
    - Export the `Celebrity` model.

## Iteration #2: Adding New Celebrities

Now that we have defined *celebrity* model, let's make it so the user can **add new celebrities to the database**.

|     Route     | HTTP Verb |          Description          |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| `/celebrities/new` |    GET    | Show a form to create a celebrity |
|   `/celebrities/create`   |   POST    | Send the data from the form to this route to create the celebrity and save it to the database  |

### Steps we will follow in this iteration:

1. In the routes file (`routes/celebrities-routes.js`) create the following GET route: `/celebrities/new`
2. In that route we have to render the `celebrities/new-celebrity` view
4. In that view file:
   - Add an `<h2>` for the page's heading.
   - Add a `<form>` tag that makes a POST request to `/celebrities/create`.
   - Add `<input>` tags inside the form so the user can fill in values for each attribute of the celebrity.  Make an input for `name`, `occupation`, and `catchPhrase`
   - Add a `<button>` tag in the form so the user can submit the form once they are done filling it out.
5. Create the `/celebrities/create` POST route in `routes/celebrities-routes.js`.
6. In that route we have to **create** an instance of the `Celebrity` model (don't forget, we should get all the info from the form through *req.body*)
    - If there is an error, render the `celebrities/new-celebrity` view so the user can try again and 
    - If there is no error, redirect to the page with the list of celebrities
7. In the `views/celebrities/index.hbs` view file:
    - Add a link that goes to the page you just created with the form to create a new celebrity.


## Iteration #3: Listing Our Celebrities

Now, when we've got some celebrities in the database, we can start working with them in our Express app. Let's **display a list of all the celebrities**.

Here's the route we will be using:

|   Route   | HTTP Verb |   Description   |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| `/celebrities` |    GET    | Show all celebrities |

### Steps we will follow in this iteration:

1. Create the `/celebrities` GET route in `routes/celebrities.js`.
2. In the route:
    - Use `find()` method on the `Celebrity` model to retrieve all the celebrities
    - If everything is okay, render the `celebrities/celebrities.hbs` view and pass the array of celebrities into the view as a variable
    - If there's an error, catch it
3. In the `views/celebrities/celebrities.hbs` view file:
    - Add an `<h2>` tag for the page's heading.
    - Use a `forEach` loop to display tags with each celebrity's `name`.
4. In the `views/index.hbs` (homepage) file:
    - Add a link that goes to the `/celebrities` route.

## Celebrities - Done! At least for now 😉

## Iteration #4: The `movie` model

Now when we've started all this good work, let's keep up strong and build all the routes for the *movie* model. But first, let's create the *movie* model.


The `movie` model should have:
- `title` - String
- `genre` - String
- `plot` - String
- `cast` - Array of object IDs referencing the *celebrity* model (basically, the array of celebrities' IDs) 


### Steps we will follow in this iteration:

Go back and review what you did to create the `celebrity` model.  You'll need to create a file for the model, and in that file, you'll need to create a schema for the model as well. Don't forget, you have to export the `Movie` model.

## Iteration #5: Adding New Movies

Okay, the next step is to make it so the user can **add new movies to the database**.

|     Route     | HTTP Verb |          Description          |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| `/movies/new` |    GET    | Show a form to create a movie |
|   `/movies/create`   |   POST    | Send the data from the form to this route to create the movie and save it to the database  |

### Steps we will follow in this iteration:

Review how you did this for the `celebrity` model.
  - Create 2 new routes, one to render page with the form on it, and one to send the data to after the form is filled out
    - In the GET route that displays the form to create a new movie (which renders the `movies/new-movie.hbs`), make sure you pass all the celebrities from your database so your users can choose which ones are in the cast of the movie you're just creating (**hint**: You will have to use [select multiple](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_select_multiple.asp) tag)
  - Make sure the form is making a POST request to the other route you just created (`/movies/create`)
  - In your post route, create an object with all the info you just received from the form. (Remember, `req.body`)
  - Use this object to create a new movie in the database and redirect back to the page with your list of all movies
  - Make sure to add a link to the form on the movies index page so the user can easier navigate

## Iteration #6: Listing Our Movies

Now that we've got some movies in the database, let's make a page where we list all our movies, just like we did with the `celebrity` model.

Here's the route we will be using:

|   Route   | HTTP Verb |   Description   |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| `/movies` |    GET    | Show all movies |


### Steps we will follow in this iteration:

Go back and review how you did this for the `celebrity` model.  You'll need to:
  - Create a GET route that will render the file in which we will display movies (`movies/movies.hbs`)
  - Use a database query to retrieve all the movies from your database and render the view
  - Use a `forEach` loop to display all your *movie titles* on that page
  - Add a link to the page you just created on the home page so the user can navigate to it.


## Iteration #7: The Movie Details Page

We've got a list of all movies that displays each of their *titles*, but what if we want to see the other details? In our `movies/movies.hbs` view with our list of movies, let's add links so that the user can click on any movie's title, and go to a details page of each movie.  On this page, we will show all the details of that movie.
Here's the route we will be using:

|     Route     | HTTP Verb |      Description      |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------------|
| `/movies/:id` |    GET    | Show a specific movie |


### Steps we will follow in this iteration:

1. We need `/:id` part to change dynamically as we click on different movies' titles. This being said, as part of the loop that displays each movie's title, add a link that goes to the `/movies/:id` route with the `:id` replaced by the actual movie's id 🔑
2. Create the `/movies/:id` GET route in `routes/movies-routes.js`.
3. In the route:
    - On the `Movie` model call `findOne()` or `findById()` method to retrieve the details of a specific movie by its `id`
        - Don't forget you have `cast` as the array of celebrity `id`s, and we need to `populate()` in order to get the full data about the celebrities 🎯
    - If everything is fine (*.then()*), render the `movies/movie-details` view and pass the variable with the movie's details into the view
    - If there's an error, catch it.
4. In the `views/movies/movie-details.hbs` view file:
    - Add an `<h2>` for the page's heading.
    - Display tags with the movie's `title`, `genre`, `plot` and `cast`.

## Iteration #8: Deleting Movies

Now that we have a list of movies, a movie details page, and a page to create new movies, we only have 2 features left to implement: *editing* celebrities and *deleting* them.  Since deleting is simpler, let's start with that.

|        Route         | HTTP Verb |       Description       |
|----------------------|-----------|-------------------------|
| `/movies/:id/delete` |   POST    | Delete a specific movie |

### Steps we will follow in this iteration:

1. In the `movies/movie-details.hbs` file:
    - Add a `<form>` tag that makes a POST request to `/movies/:id/delete` where the `:id` is replaced by the actual `id` of the movie.
    - Add a `<button>` tag inside the form so that it can be submitted.
2. Create the `/movies/:id/delete` POST route in your `routes/movies-routes.js` file
3. In the route:
    - Use the `Movie` model's `findByIdAndRemove()` method to delete the specific movie by its `id`.
    - If everything is good (`.then()`), redirect to the list of movies page  
    - If there's an error, catch it

## Iteration #9: Editing Movies

Final piece of our CRUD puzzle: **editing existing movies**.

Here are the routes we will be using:

|       Route        | HTTP Verb |          Description          |
|--------------------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| `/movies/:id/edit` |    GET    | Show a form to edit a movie |
|   `/movies/:id`    |   POST    | Send the data from the form to this route to update the specific movie         |

### Steps we will follow in this iteration:

1. Create the `/celebrities/:id/edit` GET route in `routes/movies-routes.js`.
2. In that route:
    - Call the `Movie` model’s `findOne()` or `findById()` method to retrieve a specific movie by its *id*
    - If everything is good, render the `movies/edit-movie` view
    - Pass the variable with the movie's details into the view
3. In the `movies/edit-movie.hbs` view file:
    - Add an `<h2>` tag for the page's heading.
    - Add a `<form>` tag that makes a POST request to `/movies/:id` with the `:id` replaced by the actual movie's *id*.
    - Add `<input>` tags inside the form for each attribute of the movie.
      - **Hint**: When you render the edit form, make sure each of the input fields is pre-filled with the current value of the attribute for that movie
    - Add a `<button>` tag inside the form so that the user can submit the form once they are done editing.
    - **BONUS**: Make the current cast members *selected* so the user knows who is in the cast currently.
5. Create `/movies/:id` POST route in the `routes/movies-routes.js` file
6. In that route:
    - Create an object with movie's model keys and it's values should come from the form submission (which is `req.body`)
    - Now you can apply different methods - `update()` or `findByIdAndUpdate()` to find the movie and send the updated values to the database.
    - If there is no error, redirect back to the movie details page.

Now you can come back to the bonus part related to the celebrity model :wink:.


**That's it! 🏆**

Happy Coding! :heart:
